# Airplane Challenge in Javascript

- This is a re-do of the airport challenge but slightly simplified, as a means of me learning more about Javascript and Node.

## Functionality should be as follows:
  - Airports hold planes
  - Airports have a set capacity of planes
  - Planes can land in airports
  - Planes can take off from airports

## Conditions that will throw errors:
  - a plane cannot take off from an airport it is not in
  - a plane cannot land in an airport which has reached it's capacity

## Manual Feature Test
